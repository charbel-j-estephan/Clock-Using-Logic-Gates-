## Overview

The "Clock Using Logic Gates" project is a practical implementation of a digital clock, built entirely using discrete logic gates. It is an excellent learning resource for those exploring the basics of digital electronics and logical circuit design.

## Features

- Fully functional clock with seconds, minutes, and hours.
- Built using only logic gates (no microcontrollers).
- Modular design for easy understanding and scalability.
- Educational and beginner-friendly.

## Required Components

- Basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, etc.)
- Flip-flops (T, D, or JK)
- Clock signal generator
- 7-segment displays or LEDs for time display
- Resistors and capacitors (if required for debouncing or smoothing signals)
- Power supply

## How It Works

1. **Clock Pulse Generation**: A stable pulse generator provides the base timing signal.
2. **Counting Logic**: Sequential counters track the number of pulses to calculate seconds, minutes, and hours.
3. **Reset Logic**: Handles proper resets when seconds reach 60 or hours reach 24/12 (based on configuration).
4. **Display Logic**: Binary counters are converted into decimal values for display on 7-segment displays or other output devices.

The entire system works in a coordinated fashion to simulate timekeeping, driven entirely by logic circuitry.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Knowledge of digital logic gates and circuits.
- Circuit simulation software like Logisim, Multisim, or equivalent (optional for virtual testing).
- A breadboard or PCB setup for hardware implementation (if building physically).

### Steps

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/charbel-j-estephan/Clock-Using-Logic-Gates-.git
2. Open the design files in your preferred circuit simulation software or follow the schematic for hardware implementation.
3. Test the clock's functionality by simulating or powering the physical circuit.
